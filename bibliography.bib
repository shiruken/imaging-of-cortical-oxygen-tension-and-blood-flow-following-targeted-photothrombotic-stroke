annote = {Combines high resolution blood flow imaging with mapping of absolute pO2 values using LSCI and phosphorescence quenching

Uses a DMD to selectively illuminate arbitrary shaped regions of tissue in order to retain high temporal resolution by using a PMT

Phosphorescence quenching methods are almost always limited to a single spatial location and only a few have actually produced spatial maps. 
	These typically required either scanning lasers or extremely sensitive cameras with gated 	exposure times - take longer to acquire because of scanning and/or require much averaging 	to achieve desired SNR

LSCI - 808nm 30mW laser diode at 45{\textdegree} angle 20cm away from animal, CMOS camera (Basler) at 100fps and 5ms exposure time

pO2 - 532nm laser light, gated with acoustic optical modulator, 10{\textmu}s pulses @ 1kHz, passes through two 700nm bandpass filters before being collected by PMT, Oxyphor R2

Induced ischemia with topical ET-1 (vasoconstricting agent) and photothrombotic production of singlet oxygen from Oxyphor R2 excited by higher energy light targeted by the DMD
	 - Cannot image and cause photothrombosis at the same time

annote = {Need to better understand relationship between neuronal activity and hemodynamic response

PET and fMRI are most common neuroimaging modalities but are limited in spatiotemporal resolution and effectiveness of calibration, respectively

Optical techniques offer higher spatiotemporal resolution and more quantitative measurements based on contrast mechanisms

Multispectral imagine requires modeling migration of photons and therefore assumptions about optical tissues parameters that are probably actually dynamic

Measurement of pO2 based on oxygen-based quenching of phosphorescence should not be affected by optical parameters of tissue and provide an absolute measurement of pO2

Presents instrumentation combining phosphorescence lifetime imaging with laser speckle contrast imaging to achieve high-speed wide-field images of pO2 and rCBR.

Produces simultaneous 2D maps of absolute pO2 value (via phosphorescence lifetime imaging) in brain vasculature and rCBF (via laser speckle contrast imaging)

Oxyphor R2 was the phosphorescent probe
Time-domain measurement, each pixel was fitted to the Stern-Volmer relationship

annote = {Oxygen in biological systems can be measured noninvasively via phosphorescence quenching

Highly specific - Oxygen is the only small-molecule dynamic quencher present in sufficiently high concentration to result in quenching

Stern-Volmer Model: 1/$\tau$  = 1/$\tau$0 + (kq)*(pO2)
	$\tau$ = phosphorescence lifetime at a specific oxygen pressure pO2 (measured by device)
	$\tau$0 = phosphorescence lifetime in the absence of oxygen (measured at pO2 = 0)
	kq = quenching constant (obtained from literature)

Polyglutamic dendritic porphyrins (Oxyphor R2 and G2) offered partial solution to foreign albumin toxicity (previously required to enhance aqueous solubility) 

Oxyphor R2 and G2 still depend upon albumin-rich environments, otherwise erroneous signal

Oxyphor R4 and G4 created by encapsulating inside hydrophobic dendrimers and then peripheral PEGylation is used to ensure high aqueous solubility and prevents the porphyrins from interacting with biological macromolecules. 

Dynamic phosphorescence measurements were conducted with a phosphorometer (time-domain)

Phosphorescence lifetime imaging was conducted using a wide-field macroscope system (8-bit ICCD camera with internal intensifier with macrozoom lens and long-pass filter) with an LED light source (635nm) (time-domain)

Oxyphor R4 and G4 are dependent upon the temperature but independent of the pH and found to be stable without aggregation at concentrations up to 10^-4 M. They also function independent of the albumin concentration and are stable for long periods of storage. 

pO2 of normal muscle and tumor tissue was found to be dependent upon the amount of anesthesia (high levels of isofluorane led to abrupt decreases in tissue pO2).
